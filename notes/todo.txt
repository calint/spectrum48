[ ] consider controller keys to be more "spectrum era" such as q/o/p
[ ] fix bug when hero falls below the screen into the color attributes
    generating color artifacts
[x] `render_sprite_occupied_tiles` for a tighter version rather than
    `render_single_tile`
[ ] pre-shifted sprites
[ ] extend from 1 sprite to multiple stored in a table
[ ] use sjasmplus with support for structs
[-] consider using screen_lut
    => current method is most of the time more efficient and in certain cases
       such as tile to screen address is simpler because of the 8 lines per tile
       makes bit shuffling easier
